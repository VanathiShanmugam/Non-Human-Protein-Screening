# Non-Human Protein Screening

### Automated BLAST-Based Similarity Analysis Using Biopython

---

## ✨ Features

✔ Automated BLASTP analysis against human proteins
✔ Identification of pathogen-specific proteins
✔ Non-human similarity scoring framework
✔ Retry handling for stable NCBI querying
✔ CSV-based result generation

---

## 🧬 Project Overview

This project presents a Python-based computational workflow for identifying proteins with low similarity to human proteins using the NCBI BLAST API and Biopython.

Protein sequences are queried against the `nr` database restricted to *Homo sapiens*, enabling prioritization of proteins that may serve as potential pathogen-specific therapeutic targets.

The workflow calculates:

* Highest human sequence identity
* Non-human similarity score

Applications include:

* Drug target prioritization
* Comparative proteomics
* Computational pathogen analysis

---

## ⚙️ Workflow

### 📥 1. Input Processing

* Protein FASTA sequences parsed using Biopython `SeqIO`

---

### 🌐 2. BLASTP Search

Each sequence is queried against:

* Database: `nr`
* Organism filter: `Homo sapiens`

using the NCBI BLAST web service.

---

### 📊 3. Similarity Scoring

For each protein:

* Best human identity (%) is extracted
* Non-human similarity score is calculated:

```text id="z5x3mq"
Non_Human_Score = 1 - (Best_Identity / 100)
```

Higher scores indicate proteins with lower similarity to human proteins.

---

### 📤 4. Output Generation

Results are exported as:

```bash id="m4w2oe"
non_human_similarity_scores.csv
```

containing:

* Protein ID
* Best human identity (%)
* Non-human similarity score
